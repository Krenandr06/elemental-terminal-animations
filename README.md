- 🌊 **Water**

🪨 **Earth** is planned but not yet built.

## ✨ What Is This?

Elemental Terminal Animations is a small set of shell functions you can source into your terminal session. Once loaded, you can run simple commands like:

```bash
fire
water
air
```

Each command displays a looping ASCII-style animation inspired by that element.

These are meant to be:
- Relaxing
- Fun
- A little magical
- Easy to modify or remix
